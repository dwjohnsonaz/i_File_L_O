# i_File_L_O
IBMi File/Table look up, display, print, and conversions
This tool was developed to aid developers that need to see the Layout of a file/table, Print the Layout, and gives them the ability to generate the basic structure for ETL situations. So far SQL Create scripts can be generated for IBM i (source member), MicroSoft SQL Server, MariaDB (MySQL), and Oracle. A Basic Excel .csv can be generated. In addition to those features, Schemas for both XML and JSON can be generated. All of the above scripts are stored in the IBM i Integrated File Server so that they can be easily ported to other systems. Of course the IBMi SQL create script is stored in a source member of a QSQLSRC source physical file. The GIT versioning is managed using IBM's IDE - RDi. This is done through iProjects.
